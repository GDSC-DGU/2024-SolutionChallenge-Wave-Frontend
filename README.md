# What is Wave's Solution?
### ***"Wave from us save from war"***
"Wave from us, save from war" is our slogan, under which our app was born with the belief that small ripples can create a massive change.
Our service is dedicated to maintaining and elevating awareness of **ongoing conflicts**, addressing the challenge of **declining public interest as wars continue**.  
By offering an **Interactive War Map** that provides real-time updates and news on conflicts, alongside integrated features for **making donations**, we aim to actively engage the **global community**.  
This approach not only keeps the audience informed about the latest developments in conflict zones but also facilitates **direct support to affected areas**, ensuring that the momentum of global empathy and aid is sustained over time.
